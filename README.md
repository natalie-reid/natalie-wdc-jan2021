Repository for my Wellesley Data Collective January Project work.

This repository contains the project I completed in January 2021 for the Wellesley Data Collective. I explored data regarding Wellesley's courses from Fall of 2000 through Spring of 2021. Specifically, I was interested in examining how full classes in each department have been over time. The 'WellesleyCourses' folder contains xlsx files for the course data, and the jupyter notebook contains all of the code that was written to explore this information. This data is directly from Wellesley College and is considered to be accurate. Some minor changes to the data were made to facilitate analysis but nothing was altered that disturbed the meaning of the data.
